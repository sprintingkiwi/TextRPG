# TextRPG

A text-based role-playing game written in C#. You can also use [this game's engine](https://github.com/sprintingkiwi/TextRPG/blob/main/TextRPG.cs) to build your own Text RPG.
I might write a tutorial in the wiki.

The official release of my game can be found here: https://sprintingkiwi.itch.io/hood-and-horns
